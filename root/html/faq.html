                    It is a system that is used to create, manage and analyze "information". This information is
                    formatted in a variety of different data types; both spatial and non-spatial. The purpose of GIS
                    is to help its users to make sense of their data's patterns and relationships in a geographic
                    context.

                    SQL is an acronym that stands for Structured Query Language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is a language specifically used to relay data and information to a database and most often
                    a relational database management system (RDMS). This language allows for things as simple as
                    a query that shows information that resides within a database; as complex as having an external
                    application update, delete or create data through a server over a network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SQL does have a few different dialects with slightly different syntax. So its always a good idea
                    to make sure you know which dialect the database you are communicating with works in.

                <h3>What is Python</h3>

                <p>
                    Python is a high-level interpreted programming language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall Python is a very easy to learn and use programming language that has been growing fast
                    in popularity. The best explanation I found was through wikipedia, and it states:
                    <span class="italics">
                        "Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
                        including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.
                        It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard
                        library."
                    </span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being an interpreted programming language that means that the code is executed on the fly as
                    a program or script is run: line-by-line. This is in contrast to other languages like C++ or Java
                    which specifically need to be compiled in order to be run.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A drawback of an interpreted language is it does run much slower than a compiled language due to
                    the on-the-fly execution of code
                </p>

                <h3>What makes a GIS Developer Different from Other Developers</h3>
            </button>
            <div class="drop_d_box_content">
                <p>
                    The main difference is the inclusion and integration of spatial data and objects into development
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although there is lots of intersection between regular Developers like Python, Java or C++.
                    GIS developers are a more niche subset of developers that have to consider different things when
                    developing their code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A good example of this is projections and transformations. The earth is a spheroid and spatial data
                    is captured in a Geographic Coordinate System generally in Latitude and Longitude. When someone
                    wants to map or analyze their spatial data they need to convert it into a planar coordinate
                    system to do this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When doing this you will have to think about the datum that the data was captured in and the medium
                    that is being used for the mapping or analysis. Additionally, there is always compromise that must
                    be made in order for this conversion to happen. You have to consider things like whether you
                    want an equal area, or do you want distance or shape preserved and that will affect the projected
                    coordinate system that you will use.
