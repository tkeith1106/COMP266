            My role within Matrix is as a GIS Developer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of work I like to play competitive men's league hockey in the fall/winter and golf in the
            spring/summer. I am also a hard core Edmonton Oilers fan.
        </p>
        <p>
            I grew up in Olds, Alberta, Canada in a large family with 5 other siblings and my parents. Growing up hockey
            was a major part of my identity. I was on skates from the ages of 4 and started to gravitate to the elite
            level of hockey in Atom. I played AA & AAA hockey throughout Atom to Midget and a tiny bit of Junior hockey
            as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I was 17 years of age I also become obsessed with become a pilot. I entered into ground school at 17 and
            had achieved my private pilots license just after my 18th birthday. Upon graduation from high school I was
            accepted into Mount Royal University in their Aviation Diploma program. I quickly learned that flying for me
            was a huge passion but not one that I wanted to make my day job; flying commercially for some reason took the
            fun out of flying for me. At that point I decided that flying would be a hobby as mine instead of a career.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I left Mount Royal, I thought my next calling was going to be aircraft mechanics. I entered into the
            Southern Alberta Institute of Technology's (SAIT) aircraft maintenance engineers diploma and graduated that
            a few years later. While working in the industry I realized that that was also something that I did not want
            to be doing for the rest of my life. After coming to this very similar realization I started to search for
            a new career and that is when I found out about Geographic Information Systems from my brother who was taking
            the program at SAIT. That lead me into the career I have today and i could not be happier with that choice.

        <h2>Career Walk-through</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="index_walkthrough">
        <p>
            I am a Detail orientated GIS Developer with around 5 years of industry experience. I started out in
            environmental consulting as a AutoCAD Technician with a company know as ProspEX Resources; after I received
            my 'AutoCAD Certificate of Completion' from SAIT. At ProspEX
            I worked to complete technical drawings and field & reporting figures for my company with the AutoCAD design
            software.
        </p>
        <p>
            After 2 years of doing this I entered into the 'Applied Bachelors of Geographic Information Systems'
            at SAIT and as part of my required practicum I gained employment at Matrix Solutions Inc. as a GIS Analyst.
            While working as a GIS Analyst at Matrix, I created field and reporting figures within the ArcDesktop and
            ArcPro Software Suites. In addition to creating figures I also performed any spatial and non-spatial
            analysis needed to supplement the figures I would create for our clients.
        </p>
        <p>
            While at Matrix, I developed a passion for solving unique and complex problems that we would encounter in our
            day-to-day work. This lead me down the path of a developer and with Matrix's guidance into a role a permanent
            role as a GIS Developer. Within this role I have further grown as a professional and built myself up with a
            multi-faceted skill-set within the python programming language and the ESRI suite of softwares including but
            not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mapping Automation</li>
            <li>Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) Design & Development</li>
            <li>Custom Geoprocessing Tools</li>
            <li>Enterprise Spatial and Non-spatial Data Management & Analysis</li>
            <li>Relational Database Design</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Including the aformentioned profession skills I also have a demonstrated ability to work in high pressure
            environments that require precise time management and fast turn-arounds and have developed competent
            interpersonal and project management abilities.
