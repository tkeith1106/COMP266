                        My role within Matrix is as a GIS Developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of work I like to play competitive men's league hockey in the fall/winter and golf in the
                        spring/summer. I am also a hard core Edmonton Oilers fan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I grew up in Olds, Alberta, Canada in a large family with 5 other siblings and my parents.
                        Growing up hockey was a major part of my identity. I was on skates from the ages of 4 and
                        started to gravitate to the elite level of hockey in Atom. I played AA & AAA hockey throughout
                        Atom to Midget and a tiny bit of Junior hockey as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I was 17 years of age I also become obsessed with become a pilot. I entered into ground
                        school at 17 and had achieved my private pilots license just after my 18th birthday. Upon
                        graduation from high school I was accepted into Mount Royal University in their Aviation Diploma
                        program. I quickly learned that flying for me was a huge passion but not one that I wanted to
                        make my day job; flying commercially for some reason took the fun out of flying for me. At that
                        point I decided that flying would be a hobby as mine instead of a career.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I left Mount Royal, I thought my next calling was going to be aircraft mechanics. I entered
                        into the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology's (SAIT) aircraft maintenance engineers diploma
                        and graduated that a few years later. While working in the industry I realized that that was
                        also something that I did not want  to be doing for the rest of my life. After coming to this
                        very similar realization I started to search for a new career and that is when I found out about
                        Geographic Information Systems from my brother who was taking the program at SAIT. That lead me
                        into the career I have today; I could not be happier with that choice.

                    <h2>Career Walk-through</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am a Detail orientated GIS Developer with around 5 years of industry experience. I started out
                        in environmental consulting as a AutoCAD Technician with a company know as ProspEX Resources;
                        after I received  my 'AutoCAD Certificate of Completion' from SAIT. At ProspEX I worked to
                        complete technical drawings and field & reporting figures for my company with the AutoCAD design
                        software.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After 2 years of doing this I entered into the 'Applied Bachelors of Geographic Information
                        Systems' at SAIT and as part of my required practicum I gained employment at Matrix Solutions
                        Inc. as a GIS Analyst. While working as a GIS Analyst at Matrix, I created field and reporting
                        figures within the ArcDesktop and ArcPro Software Suites. In addition to creating figures I also
                        performed any spatial and non-spatial analysis needed to supplement the figures I would create
                        for our clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While at Matrix, I developed a passion for solving unique and complex problems that we would
                        encounter in our day-to-day work. This lead me down the path of a developer and with Matrix's
                        guidance into a role a permanent role as a GIS Developer. Within this role I have further
                        grown as a professional and built myself up with a multi-faceted skill-set within the python
                        programming language and the ESRI suite of software's including but not limited to:
                    </p>

                        <li>Mapping Automation</li>
                        <li>Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) Design & Development</li>
                        <li>Custom Geoprocessing Tools</li>
                        <li>Enterprise Data Management & Analysis</li>
                        <li>Relational Database Design</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Including the aformentioned profession skills I also have a demonstrated ability to work in high
                        pressure environments that require precise time management and fast turn-around's and have
                        developed competent interpersonal and project management abilities.
